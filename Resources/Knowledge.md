*Goal of learning the major scale early*
- We will want to know how to play this up and down forever, so it's best to learn it.
- Playing single note exercises trains our hands to move more independently. This helps with chords also.
- Playing single note exercises is good for our right hand picking. We should usually be **alternate picking**. (Try a slightly less flexible pick)



#### Exercise
