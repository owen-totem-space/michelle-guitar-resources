## Beginner Chords
I'm putting this here despite the fact that I disagree with this approach. However, this is basically how I learned chords. I think the hand positions held me back and kept me stuck. Ricks thumb technique in this is awful. However, it's not entirely without merit and this is even probably the most common way to learn.
